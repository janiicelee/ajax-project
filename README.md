# My Ghibli

A web application for Studio Ghibli fans who want to make reviews on their favorite films.

### Why?
I love watching Hayao Miyazaki's films since I was a kid and I can still watch the same movie over and over again. As a big fan, I found out that Studio Ghibli has its own public API and thought it would be a good idea to make an app with it. So I created a simple CRUD app where the user can see the posters of the movie, see the detail information of the movie, leave reviews and delete or edit it!
